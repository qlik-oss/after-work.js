Run your test headless/headful in Chrome with great developer workflow. Just start the runner with

```
npx aw puppeteer -c ./path/to/aw.config.js -w
```

and start testing. It will only rerun affected tests on save.
Add files, remove files as you go and change your tests to rapidly build up a test coverage.
