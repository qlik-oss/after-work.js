## Getting started

Make sure you meet the [requirements](./requirements.md)

Install all packages with:

```sh
npm i -D @after-work.js/aw
```

Now you have a couple of sub commands available

```sh
npx aw -h
```

## Custom

If you only need the node runner:

```sh
npm i -D @after-work.js/cli @after-work.js/node
```
