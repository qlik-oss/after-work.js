`after-work.js` is an unified test framework highly configurable through cli and configuration files allowing tests to be executed in the desired context.

## Requirements

### Default runner

* [node](./docs/node.md#node): Node.js >= 8.9.4

### Context dependent

* [cdp](./docs/cdp.md#cdp) (Chrome Debugging Protocol): Chrome > 61
* [protractor](./docs/protractor.md#protractor-config) (webdriver protocol): protractor 5.x + browser(s)
* [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) (High-level Headless Chrome Node API - experimental): puppeteer

## Introduction
`after-work.js` aims to be a tool that facilitates the testing while development or restructuring code.
Designed for test and provide fast feedback on changed code and added testcases.

To configure `after-work.js` you need to start with an analyse of the code.
* What context should it be executed in (Node.js, browser)
* What type of tests should be executed (unit, component, integration, e2e)
* Does the code have any dependencies to build or run (babel...)

## Get started

### Installation
Install the module using npm:
```sh
npm install --save-dev after-work.js
```

### CLI entrypoint
`after-work.js` is CLI and consists of a command together with appropriate options
Help is always available with the `--help, -h` option
```
aw <command>

Commands:
  aw node        Run tests in node                                                         [default]
  aw protractor  Run protractor                                                      [aliases: ptor]
  aw cdp         Run tests with cdp (chrome devtools protocol)                     [aliases: chrome]
  aw serve       Serve files
  aw puppeteer   Run tests with puppeteer                                          [aliases: puppet]
```

All commands support passing a config file for all options.

```shell
npx aw -c ./path/to/aw.config.js
```

However, passing an option from command line will override the config file option.

```shell
npx aw -c ./path/to/aw.config.js --glob /path/that/overrides/glob/in/config/file
```

This enables easy debugging setup from modern editors for example [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

This will only run the current active file. And you don't have to worry about your tests timing out
since `after-work.js` will automatically detect running a debugger and set the appropriate options accordingly.

## Included Tools
The following tools are bundled into after-work.js:
* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/): an extensible testing framework for TDD or BDD.

* [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/): a framework for standalone test spies, stubs and mocks for JavaScript.
* [Nyc](https://istanbul.js.org/): the Istanbul command line interface
