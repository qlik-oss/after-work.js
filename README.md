after-work.js is designed to be your preferred choice when it comes to testing. It acts as an unified testing framework from the lowest level up to the system level.

[![Testing Pyramid](./docs/Pyramid.png)](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html)

More details on how to use the framework can be found in [Using after-work.js](./docs/usage.md) there every level of the test pyramid is explained.

Or you can go directly to the different test levels:
* [unit](./docs/unit.md): used for testing business logic and business rules without interaction with UI components at all.
* [component](./docs/component.md): used for testing interaction with components on isolated part of the system (fixtures that contains stubs, spies, mocks).
* [integration](./docs/integration.md): used for testing interaction with components that communicates with peer components.
* [system / end to end](./docs/e2e.md): used for testing a flow scenario of the whole product.
